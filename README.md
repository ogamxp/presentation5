# What is Object in JavaScript?

    In JavaScript, an object is a standalone
    entity, with properties and type.
    Compare it with a cup, for example. A
    cup is an object, with properties. A cup
    has a color, a design, weight, a material
    it is made of, etc. The same way,
    JavaScript objects can have properties,
    which define their characteristics.
    Everything is an object in JavaScript.
    JavaScript object is a nonprimitive data-type that allows you to
    store multiple collections of data

# Object Methods

# 1. Object.entries()
    ex:
    const obj = {name: "Adam", age: 20,};
    console.log(Object.entries(obj));
    // Output: [ [ 'name', 'Adam' ], [ 'age',20 ] ]

# 2. Object. keys()
    ex:
    const obj = {name: "Adam", age: 20,};
    console.log(Object.keys(obj));
    // Output: [ 'name', 'age' ]

# 3. Object. values()
    ex:
    const obj = {name: "Adam", age: 20,};
    console.log(Object.keys(obj));
    // Output: [ 'Adam', 20 ]

# Destructuring AND spread in object

The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it
possible to unpack properties from object, into distinct variables
